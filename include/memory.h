/**
 * @brief Manages dynamic memory in pepita, including allocation, deallocation,
 * and resizing.
 *
 * The `reallocate()` function serves as a central point for all dynamic memory
 * management operations in pepita. It intelligently handles various scenarios
 * based on the old and new sizes provided.
 *
 * @details The behavior of `reallocate()` for various size parameters:
 * - When `oldSize` is 0 and `newSize` is non-zero, a new block is allocated.
 * - When `oldSize` is non-zero and `newSize` is 0, the existing block is
 * deallocated.
 * - For non-zero `oldSize` and `newSize`, if `newSize` is smaller, the function
 * shrinks the existing block.
 * - For non-zero `oldSize` and `newSize`, if `newSize` is larger, the function
 * tries to grow the block.
 *
 * Internally, deallocation is handled by calling `free()`. In other cases, the
 * function leans on the C standard library's `realloc()`. Here's how:
 * - If `oldSize` is 0, `realloc()` acts like `malloc()`.
 * - If both sizes are non-zero, `realloc()` tries to resize the block.
 * - If `newSize` is smaller, it updates the size and returns the same pointer.
 * - If `newSize` is larger and there's adjacent free memory, it grows the
 * block.
 * -If there isn't enough free space, `realloc()` allocates a new block,
 * copies the old data, frees the old block, and returns the new block's
 * pointer.
 *
 * @param pointer Pointer to the memory block to manage.
 * @param oldSize Current size of the memory block.
 * @param newSize Desired size for the memory block.
 * @return Pointer to the managed memory block. It could be the same or a new
 * location if reallocated.
