 *
 * @details Bytecode is an intermediate representation of code, typically used
 * as a step between source code and machine code. By converting source
 * code into bytecode, a system can then use a virtual machine or interpreter
 * to execute the bytecode directly, allowing for portability across
 * multiple platforms.
 *
 * Within this module, we define the basic structures and operations
 * that our system uses to represent and manipulate bytecode.
